Description:
dongled - Android Service Deamon which listens to usb devices using the UEVENT Socket

Purpose:
This daemon handles the intialization of 3G Dongles, Mainly Manaufactured by Huawei and can be used in place
place usb_modeswitch.

Motivation:
The ability to do more with less is the primary goal here. It forms part of a greater whole to make
a framework for managing external USB Modems on android.

Method:
The service waits the UEVENT of a valid device which is then processed by the internal implementation of
the usb_modeswitch. If the modeswitch is successful then the ril-daemon service is started to carry on the 
process of establishing a connection. A devices validality is first looked for in the daemons internal list 
for valid modeswitch configuaration. If none is found internally a number of known location are.
This retains the flexibility of the usb_modeswitch configuration files while wrapping the known good configuaration.

Madness:
This service has a static dependency on libusb-1.x . Albeit a slighty tweaked version for Android.
This service has a static dependency on libusb-0.1.x , Yes you read that right.
It is probably breaking some fundamental law of the universe some similar to the ghostbusters crossing
the streams.
